## 💡 Project: Interview Trainer Agent

### 🔷 Problem Statement

Job seekers often struggle to prepare effectively for interviews due to a lack of personalized guidance. Most preparation platforms provide general advice, but don't adapt to a candidate's **specific job role, experience level, or resume content**.

This leads to low confidence, poor interview performance, and missed opportunities in competitive job markets.

---

### 🔷 Solution Overview

The **Interview Trainer Agent** is an AI-based assistant designed to act like a personal interview coach. Using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **IBM Granite foundation models**, the system delivers:

- Role-specific **technical & HR questions**
- **Model answers** and feedback
- **Behavioral scenarios** with response strategies
- Continuous improvement tips

Users provide a resume or job title, and the agent tailors a preparation kit based on real-world data from recruitment portals, professional networks, and interview databases.

This personalized preparation experience boosts candidate confidence and readiness.
